# O3Measure Active Context

## Current Development Focus
We have completed the planning and architecture definition phase for the O3Measure application and finalized our technology choices. Key decisions include:

1. **Pure A-Frame Approach**: Using A-Frame directly without React integration
2. **Feature-Oriented Architecture**: Application organized around independent features that manage their own state and UI
3. **Event-Based Communication**: Features communicate through A-Frame's event system
4. **Tracer Bullet Approach**: Implementation will follow a phased approach that builds a working foundation first

## Recent Progress
- Defined feature-oriented architecture approach
- Created documentation for project structure
- Established implementation task breakdown
- Created A-Frame summary information
- Organized documentation structure
- Finalized technology stack decisions
- Cleaned up package.json dependencies
- Updated build configuration

## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **A-Frame Only**: Pure A-Frame approach without React integration
- **Vite Build System**: For bundling and development server
- **Standard ES Modules**: For code organization
- **Minimalist Dependencies**: Only essential packages included

### Architecture Decisions
- **Feature-Oriented Design**: Self-contained features rather than global state management
- **Event-Based Communication**: Using A-Frame's native event system for component communication
- **Minimal Shared State**: Only truly global concerns managed centrally
- **DOM-Based Entity Creation**: Direct DOM manipulation for creating A-Frame entities

### Implementation Strategy
- Using a tracer bullet approach to quickly establish core functionality
- Implementation will proceed in phases, starting with basic AR setup and controller interactions
- Each feature will be implemented as a standalone module
- Menu system will coordinate feature activation/deactivation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Create A-Frame scene with WebXR support
3. Implement controller tracking
4. Develop wrist UI foundation
5. Build menu system

### Development Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Basic AR setup with controllers
- **Phase 2**: Menu system implementation
- **Phase 3**: Wall calibration feature
- **Phase 4**: Object measurement feature
- **Phase 5**: Anchor points feature
- **Phase 6**: Wall projection feature
- **Phase 7**: Refinement and polish
- **Phase 8**: Finalization

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring accurate measurements in AR space
- Optimizing performance for mobile devices
- Creating intuitive controller-based interactions
- Handling different device capabilities
- Managing entity lifecycle efficiently

### User Experience Priorities
- Clear guidance through the measurement workflow
- Intuitive controller-based interactions
- Accurate visualization of measurements
- Smooth transitions between features

## Documentation Status
- Project structure documentation complete
- Feature-oriented approach documentation complete
- Task breakdown documentation complete
- A-Frame documentation summaries created
- Memory Bank structure established and updated with final tech decisions
