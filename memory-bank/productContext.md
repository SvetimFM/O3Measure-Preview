# O3Measure Product Context

## Problem Statement
Hanging objects on walls (pictures, TVs, shelves) often involves guesswork, trial and error, and multiple attempts. This leads to:
- Unnecessary wall damage from incorrect nail/mount placement
- Wasted time measuring and remeasuring
- Frustration when objects don't align as intended
- Difficulty visualizing the final result before committing

## Solution Approach
O3Measure tackles these problems by leveraging AR technology to:
1. Allow users to visualize objects on their walls before physical mounting
2. Provide accurate measurements of both objects and wall placement
3. Show exactly where mounting hardware should be placed
4. Give realtime feedback on positioning and alignment

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Require minimal instructions to use effectively
- **Accurate**: Provide precise measurements that translate to physical space
- **Flexible**: Work with various object types and wall configurations
- **Immersive**: Natural AR interaction that feels like manipulating real objects
- **Helpful**: Clear guidance and feedback throughout the measurement process

## User Flow
1. **Wall Selection**: User identifies and calibrates a wall surface
2. **Object Definition**: User measures the object to be hung
3. **Anchor Point Selection**: User defines mounting points on the object
4. **Wall Projection**: User positions and visualizes the object on the wall

## Target Audience
- Homeowners hanging decorations, TVs, or shelving
- Interior designers planning wall layouts
- Contractors needing to communicate placement with clients
- Anyone who wants to preview item placement before committing

## Value Proposition
O3Measure eliminates the frustration and wall damage caused by traditional hanging methods. It transforms an often tedious process into a simple, visual experience that yields perfect results on the first try.
