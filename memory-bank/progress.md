# O3Measure Progress

## Current Status
Planning and architecture phase completed. Ready to begin implementation with Phase 1 (Basic AR Setup).

## Completed Items

### Planning and Architecture
- [x] Decided on feature-oriented architecture
- [x] Established project directory structure
- [x] Created implementation task breakdown with tracer bullet approach
- [x] Documented A-Frame components and patterns
- [x] Set up Memory Bank documentation

### Technical Setup
- [x] Finalized technology stack (A-Frame only approach)
- [x] Cleaned up package.json dependencies
- [x] Updated vite.config.js for A-Frame focus
- [x] Configured build environment

### Documentation
- [x] Created PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md with feature-oriented layout
- [x] Created FEATURE_APPROACH.md explaining feature-oriented design
- [x] Updated TASKS.md with tracer bullet implementation approach
- [x] Created A-Frame documentation summaries
- [x] Set up Memory Bank with all required files

## In Progress
- [ ] Phase 1: Basic AR Setup
  - [ ] Project initialization
  - [ ] AR scene setup
  - [ ] Controller setup

## Coming Up Next
- [ ] Phase 2: Menu System
  - [ ] Wrist UI Foundation
  - [ ] Basic Menu Implementation

## Remaining Work

### Features to Implement
- [ ] Wall Calibration Feature
- [ ] Object Measurement Feature
- [ ] Anchor Points Feature
- [ ] Wall Projection Feature

### Additional Work
- [ ] Refinement and Polish
- [ ] Performance Optimization
- [ ] Multi-platform Testing
- [ ] Final Documentation

## Technical Decisions
- Pure A-Frame approach (no React integration)
- Direct DOM manipulation for entity creation
- A-Frame component-based architecture
- Native event system for communication
- Feature-oriented organizational structure

## Known Issues
- None at this stage (pre-implementation)

## Blockers
- None currently

## Notes
- Project is ready to begin implementation following the tracer bullet approach
- Architecture and technology decisions have been finalized
- Next step is to set up the basic project structure and implement Phase 1
