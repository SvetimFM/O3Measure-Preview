# O3Measure MVP Flow

## Overview
O3Measure is an AR application that helps users measure and visualize where to hang objects on walls. The MVP flow guides users through a step-by-step process to accurately place mounting points.

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Wall Selection
- UI floating above the left controller that the user interacts with using the right controller
- User places dots on a wall they want to hang something on
- we allow user small forward back adustment of the wall for fine calibration
- User can reset selection if needed
- User presses "Next" on the UI panel to proceed

### 2. Object Definition
- User places three dots to define the object's dimensions:
  - Top-left corner
  - Top-right corner
  - Bottom-right corner
- The app displays the object's width and height in inches
- User can reset this selection if needed
- User presses "Next" to proceed

### 3. Anchor Point Selection
- User selects 1-4 locations for anchor/mounting points on the object
- These represent where the object will attach to the wall
- User can reset these selections if needed
- User presses "Next" to proceed

### 4. Wall Projection
- App projects the object's dimensions onto the wall as a draggable rectangle
- Small yellow circular areas with a crosshair highlight the mounting points
- User can drag and position the object on the wall to determine ideal placement
- Object dimensions remain visible during positioning
- User can start over if needed

### UI Controls
- Left controller: Holds the floating UI panel with "Next" and "Reset" buttons
- Right controller: Used for placing dots and dragging the projection
- Squeeze/grip on right controller: Used to drag the projection on the wall

## Technical Implementation
- A-Frame for WebXR scene management
- WebXR for AR capabilities with camera passthrough
- Real-time measurement conversion to inches
- Interactive UI elements attached to VR controllers
- Hand tracking for controller-free interaction
- Support for Quest controllers with haptic feedback
- AR passthrough for a transparent background experience

## Development Status
This MVP implements the core user flow and required interactions for an initial proof of concept that demonstrates the main value proposition of helping users visualize and position objects on walls.

## Next Steps
   Workflow Steps:   
    - Wall Selection
    - Object Definition
    - Anchor Points
    - Projection
  4. Controller/Hand Tracking: The controller setup should be refactored into the custom hooks system     
   like useControllerInput.js and useHandTracking.js.
  5. UI Components: The floating panel implementation should be converted to React components in the      
  /components/ui directory.
  6. 3D Elements: Markers, visualizations, and interaction should be moved to respective components       
  in /components/three/.

  The migration requires converting imperative Three.js code to declarative React components while        
  maintaining the same workflow and functionality.
