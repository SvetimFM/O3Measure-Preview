The hand-controls component provides tracked hands (using a prescribed model) with animated gestures. hand-controls wraps the vive-controls and meta-touch-controls which in turn wrap the tracked-controls component. By specifying just hand-controls, we have something that works well with both Vive and Rift. The component gives extra events and handles hand animations and poses.

Example
