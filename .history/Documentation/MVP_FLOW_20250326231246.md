# O3Measure MVP Flow

## Overview
O3Measure is an AR application that helps users measure and visualize where to hang objects on walls. The MVP flow guides users through a step-by-step process to accurately place mounting points.

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Wall Selection
- Easy to use UI floating above the left controller that the user interacts with using the right controller
- User places dots on a wall they want to hang something on
- we allow user small forward back adustment of the wall for fine calibration
- User can reset selection if needed
- User presses "Next" on the UI panel to proceed

### 2. Object Definition
- User places three dots to define the object's dimensions:
  - Top-left corner
  - Top-right corner
  - Bottom-right corner
- The app displays the object's width and height in inches
- User can reset this selection if needed
- User presses "Next" to proceed

### 3. Anchor Point Selection
- User selects 1-4 locations for anchor/mounting points on the object
- These represent where the object will attach to the wall
- User can reset these selections if needed
- User presses "Next" to proceed

### 4. Wall Projection
- App projects the object's dimensions onto the wall as a draggable rectangle
- Small yellow circular areas with a crosshair highlight the mounting points
- User can drag and position the object on the wall to determine ideal placement
- Object dimensions remain visible during positioning
- User can start over if needed

### UI Controls
- Left controller: Holds the floating UI panel with "Next" and "Reset" buttons
- Right controller: Used for placing dots and dragging the projection
- Squeeze/grip on right controller: Used to drag the projection on the wall

## Technical Implementation
- A-Frame and WebXR 
- WebXR for AR capabilities with camera passthrough
- Real-time measurement conversion to inches
- Interactive UI elements attached to VR controllers
- Hand tracking for controller-free interaction
- Support for Quest 
- AR passthrough for a transparent background experience
