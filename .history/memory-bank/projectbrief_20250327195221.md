# O3Measure Project Brief

## Project Overview
O3Measure is an augmented reality (AR) application that helps users measure and visualize where to hang objects on walls. Using WebXR technology, it allows users to define wall surfaces, measure objects, place anchor points, and visualize how objects will look when mounted.

## Core Features
1. Wall calibration using AR hit testing and a manual three point approach (where user places three points using their controller on the wall, and we calculate the plane of the wall from their positions)
2. Object measurement with dimension calculation (through the same three point approach, top left corner of the item, top right, bottom right)
3. Anchor point placement for mounting points
4. Wall projection visualization with interactive positioning (sliding the projection around on the wall to know where to drill)
5. Wrist-mounted UI with controller-based interaction

## Technical Stack
- A-Frame for WebXR/AR implementation
- WebXR API for AR capabilities
- Three.js (via A-Frame) for 3D rendering
- Vite for bundling and development

## Goals
- Create an intuitive AR measurement tool for object placement
- Provide accurate measurements in imperial units (inches)
- Deliver a smooth, responsive user experience
- Support Meta Quest and mobile AR devices
- Implement feature-oriented architecture for maintainability and extensibility

## Success Criteria
- Users can accurately measure and visualize wall-mounted objects
- Application runs smoothly on supported devices
- UI is intuitive and requires minimal instruction
- Accurate placement visualization matches real-world dimensions
