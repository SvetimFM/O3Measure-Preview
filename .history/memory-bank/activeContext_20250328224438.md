# O3Measure Active Context

## Current Development Focus
We are currently working on the Menu System (Phase 2) of the O3Measure application. We've completed the Wrist UI Foundation task and are ready to move on to the Basic Menu Implementation.

1. **Pure A-Frame Approach**: Using A-Frame directly without React integration
2. **Feature-Oriented Architecture**: Application organized around independent features that manage their own state and UI
3. **Event-Based Communication**: Features communicate through A-Frame's event system
4. **Tracer Bullet Approach**: Implementation follows a phased approach that builds a working foundation first

## Recent Progress
- Completed Phase 1 (Basic AR Setup)
- Implemented Wrist UI Foundation
- Integrated super-hands for grabbable functionality
- Added physics system for interaction
- Created UI panel with visual feedback for interactions
- Positioned UI in front of user (changed from wrist attachment approach)

## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **A-Frame Only**: Pure A-Frame approach without React integration
- **Vite Build System**: For bundling and development server
- **Standard ES Modules**: For code organization
- **Minimalist Dependencies**: Only essential packages included
- **Added Components**:
  - **super-hands**: For grabbable UI functionality
  - **aframe-physics-system**: For physics interactions

### UI Panel Approach
1. **Initial Plan**: Attach UI to the left wrist
2. **Current Approach**: UI panel positioned in front of the user that can be grabbed and repositioned
   - Position: Default at eye level (y=1.6) and 0.5m in front of the user
   - Interaction: Grabbable and draggable with either hand using super-hands
   - Feedback: Visual cues for hover and grab states

### Component Architecture
- Created standalone `wrist-ui` component for UI panel management
- Integrated with `super-hands` for interaction
- Used A-Frame physics (`aframe-physics-system`) for grabbable functionality
- All UI components are created directly in JavaScript to maximize flexibility

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete the Basic Menu Implementation
   - Create menu component with buttons
   - Implement "Wall Calibration" menu option
   - Add activation/deactivation controls

### Development Roadmap
- **Phase 2 (In Progress)**: Menu system implementation
- **Phase 3**: Wall calibration feature
- **Phase 4**: Object measurement feature
- **Phase 5**: Anchor points feature
- **Phase 6**: Wall projection feature
- **Phase 7**: Refinement and polish
- **Phase 8**: Finalization

## Active Considerations
