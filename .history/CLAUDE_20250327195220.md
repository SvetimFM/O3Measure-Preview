# O3Measure Project - Guidelines for Claude

## Build Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with HTTPS
- `npm run build` - Build for production 
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run dev -- --host` - Start dev server on LAN for device testing

## Testing
- Device testing requires Quest headset in developer mode
- Use Chrome browser on Android for WebXR testing
- iOS/Safari currently has limited WebXR support

## Memory Bank
The `/memory-bank` directory contains essential project documentation that provides context and guidance for development:

- **projectbrief.md** - Core requirements and goals
- **productContext.md** - User experience and problem statement
- **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture and design patterns
- **techContext.md** - Technical details and dependencies
- **activeContext.md** - Current development focus and decisions
- **progress.md** - Implementation status and next steps

Reference the Memory Bank when you need high-level project context or to understand architectural decisions.

## Documentation
The `/Documentation` directory contains technical documentation:

- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Directory layout and component relationships
- **FEATURE_APPROACH.md** - Explanation of feature-oriented architecture
- **TASKS.md** - Implementation roadmap with tracer bullet approach
- **o2Measure-project-info** - Information about the MVP
- **a-frame-info/** - A-Frame documentation summaries
  - **core-api-info/** - A-Frame core API summaries
  - **controller-info/** - A-Frame controller components
  - **scene-config-info/** - A-Frame scene configuration
  - **ui-info/** - A-Frame UI components

## Code Style Guidelines

### General
- ES Modules for imports (`import * as X from 'y'`)
- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at end of statements
- Use sections with comment headers (`// ---------- SECTION NAME ----------`)

### Naming Conventions
- camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- UPPERCASE for constants
- PascalCase for classes and constructors (from Three.js convention)

### JavaScript Practices
- Group related variables at top of file or function scope
- Use const/let appropriately (prefer const when possible)
- State management through feature-specific component state
- Use descriptive variable names that indicate purpose and type
- Organize code into logical sections with comments

### A-Frame Conventions
- Implement features as self-contained components
- Use event-based communication between components
- Initialize component resources when activated
- Clean up resources when components are deactivated
